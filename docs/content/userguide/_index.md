# Gatekeeper

Gatekeeper is a proxy which integrates with OpenID Connect (OIDC) Providers, it supports both access tokens in a browser cookie or bearer tokens.

This documentation details how to build and configure Gatekeeper followed by details of how to use each of its features.

For further information, see the included help file which includes a
full list of commands and switches. View the file by entering the
following at the command line (modify the location to match where you
install Gatekeeper Proxy):

``` bash
    $ bin/gatekeeper help
```

You can view all settings also in this table [Settings](https://gogatekeeper.github.io/gatekeeper/configuration/)

## Requirements

  - Go 1.19 or higher

## Configuration options

Configuration can come from a YAML/JSON file or by using command line
options. Here is a list of options.

``` yaml
# is the URL for retrieve the OpenID configuration
discovery-url: <DISCOVERY URL>
# Indicates we should deny by default all requests and explicitly specify what is permitted, default true
# this is equivalent of --resource=/*|methods
enable-default-deny: true
# the client id for the 'client' application
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
# the secret associated to the 'client' application
client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET>
# the interface definition you wish the proxy to listen, all interfaces is specified as ':<port>', unix sockets as unix://<REL_PATH>|</ABS PATH>
listen: :3000
# port on which metrics and health endpoints will be available, if not specified it will be on above specified port
listen-admin: :4000
# whether to enable refresh tokens
enable-refresh-tokens: true
# you can set up custom templates for forbidden/error/sign-in pages, gatekeeper
# also provides these already builtin (but they are not set by default)
forbidden-page: templates/forbidden.html.tmpl
error-page: templates/error.html.tmpl
sign-in-page: sign_in.html.tmpl
# the location of a certificate you wish the proxy to use for TLS support
tls-cert:
# the location of a private key for TLS
tls-private-key:
# TLS options related to admin listener
tls-admin-cert:
tls-admin-private-key:
tls-admin-ca-certificate:
tls-admin-client-certificate:
# the redirection URL, essentially the site URL, note: /oauth/callback is added at the end
redirection-url: http://127.0.0.1:3000
# the encryption key used to encode the session state
encryption-key: <ENCRYPTION_KEY>
# the upstream endpoint which we should proxy request
upstream-url: http://127.0.0.1:80
# Returns HTTP 401 when no authentication is present, used with forward proxies or API protection with client credentials grant.
no-redirects: false
# additional scopes to add to the default (openid+email+profile)
scopes:
- vpn-user
# a collection of resource i.e. URLs that you wish to protect, this are simple gatekeeper authorization rules,
# to get more complex authorization you can look at external authorization section in our documentation
resources:
- uri: /admin/test
  # the methods on this URL that should be protected, uri is required when defining resource
  methods:
  - GET
  # a list of roles the user must have in order to access URLs under the above
  # If all you want is authentication ONLY, simply remove the roles array - the user must be authenticated but
  # no roles are required
  roles:
  - openvpn:vpn-user
  - openvpn:prod-vpn
  - test
- uri: /admin/*
  methods:
  - GET
  roles:
  - openvpn:vpn-user
  - openvpn:commons-prod-vpn
```

Options issued at the command line have a higher priority and will
override or merge with options referenced in a config file. Examples of
each style are shown in the following sections.

## Example of usage and configuration with Keycloak

Assuming you have some web service you wish protected by
Keycloak:

  - Create the **client** using the Keycloak GUI or CLI; the
    client protocol is **'openid-connect'**, access-type:
    **confidential**.

  - Add a Valid Redirect URI of
    **<http://127.0.0.1:3000/oauth/callback>**.

  - Grab the client id and client secret.

  - Create the roles under the client or existing clients for
    authorization purposes.

Here is an example configuration file.

``` yaml
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
client-secret: <CLIENT_SECRET> # require for access_type: confidential
# Note the redirection-url is optional, it will default to the the URL scheme and host, 
# only in case of forward auth it will use X-Forwarded-Proto / X-Forwarded-Host, please see forward-auth section
discovery-url: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/<REALM_NAME>
# Indicates we should deny by default all requests and explicitly specify what is permitted, default true,
# you cannot specify enable-default-deny:true together with defining resource=uri=/*
enable-default-deny: true
encryption-key: AgXa7xRcoClDEU0ZDSH4X0XhL5Qy2Z2j
listen: :3000
redirection-url: http://127.0.0.1:3000
upstream-url: http://127.0.0.1:80
# a collection of resource i.e. URLs that you wish to protect, this are simple gatekeeper authorization rules,
# to get more complex authorization you can look at external authorization section in our documentation
resources:
- uri: /admin*
  methods:
  - GET
  roles:
  # this will match realm role from token
  - examplerealmrole
  # you can see here, that roles below will match client roles from token
  # it will look for client1's client role test1 and client2's client role test2
  - client1:test1
  - client2:test2
  require-any-role: true
  groups:
  - admins
  - users
- uri: /backend*
  roles:
  - client:test1
- uri: /public/*
# Allow access to the resource above
  white-listed: true
- uri: /favicon
# Allow access to the resource above
  white-listed: true
- uri: /css/*
# Allow access to the resource above
  white-listed: true
- uri: /img/*
# Allow access to the resource above
  white-listed: true
# Adds custom headers
headers:
  myheader1: value_1
  myheader2: value_2
```

Anything defined in a configuration file can also be configured using
command line options, such as in this example.

``` bash
bin/gatekeeper \
    --discovery-url=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/<REALM_NAME> \
    --client-id=<CLIENT_ID> \
    --client-secret=<SECRET> \
    --listen=127.0.0.1:3000 \ # unix sockets format unix://path
    --redirection-url=http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
    --enable-refresh-tokens=true \
    --encryption-key=AgXa7xRcoClDEU0ZDSH4X0XhL5Qy2Z2j \
    --upstream-url=http://127.0.0.1:80 \
    --enable-default-deny=true \
    --resources="uri=/admin*|roles=test1,test2" \
    --resources="uri=/backend*|roles=test1" \
    --resources="uri=/css/*|white-listed=true" \
    --resources="uri=/img/*|white-listed=true" \
    --resources="uri=/public/*|white-listed=true" \
    --headers="myheader1=value1" \
    --headers="myheader2=value2"
```

## Roles

By default, the roles defined on a resource perform a logical `AND` so
all roles specified must be present in the claims, this behavior can be
altered by the `require-any-role` option, however, so as long as one
role is present the permission is granted.

You can match on realm roles or client roles:

```yaml
resources:
- uri: /admin*
  methods:
  - GET
  roles:
  # this will match realm role from token
  - examplerealmrole
  # you can see here, that roles below will match client roles from token
  # it will look for client1's client role test1 and client2's client role test2
  - client1:test1
  - client2:test2
```

If you have roles listed in some custom claim, please see [custom claim matching](#claim-matching)

## Authentication flows

You can use gatekeeper to protect APIs, frontend server applications, frontend client applications.
Frontend server-side applications can be protected by Authorization Code Flow (also with PKCE), during which several redirection
steps take place. For protecting APIs you can use Client Credentials Grant to avoid redirections steps
involved in authorization code flow you have to use `--no-redirects=true`. For frontend applications
you can use Authorization Code Flow (also with PKCE) with encrypted refresh token cookies enabled, in this case however you have to handle redirections
at login/logout and you must make cookies available to js (less secure, altough at least they are encrypted).

## Default Deny

`--enable-default-deny` - option blocks all requests without valid token on all basic HTTP methods,
(DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT, TRACE). **WARNING:** There are no additional requirements on
the token, it isn't checked for some claims or roles, groups etc...(this is by default true)

`--enable-default-deny-strict` (recommended) - option blocks all requests (including valid token) unless
specific path with requirements specified in resources (this option is by default false)

## Upstream Host Proxy and OpenID Provider Proxy

By default the communication with the OpenID provider is direct. If you
wish, you can specify a forwarding proxy server in your configuration
file:

``` yaml
openid-provider-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

or you can use standard env variables: `HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY`

By default also communication with upstream is direct, if you would like
to use proxy server to forward traffic upstream you can use configuration file:

```yaml
upstream-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:8080
upstream-no-proxy: http://donotproxy.example.com:8080
```

or corresponding env variables: `PROXY_UPSTREAM_PROXY, PROXY_UPSTREAM_NO_PROXY`

## HTTP routing

By default, all requests will be proxied on to the upstream, if you wish
to ensure all requests are authenticated you can use this:

``` bash
--resources=uri=/* # note, unless specified the method is assumed to be 'any|ANY'
```

The HTTP routing rules follow the guidelines from
[chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi#router-design). The ordering of the
resources does not matter, the router will handle that for you.

## Cookies size

All browsers have limitations on cookies number and cookie size. This usually does not adhere
to any standard. E.g. Chrome has limitation of 4096 bytes on all cookies per domain.
This might cause you troubles e.g. Chrome responding with 431 Request Header Fields are Too Large.
To overcome this limitations gatekeeper offers several options:

`--enable-id-token-cookie` - is set by default false, in case you don't need id token, leave it/turn it off
`--store-url` - this will enable storing of refresh token in redis store, instead of cookies, which saves you some bytes,
also has some additional effect of raising security on client side as refresh token won't be exposed on client side

## Session-only cookies

By default, the access and refresh cookies are session-only and disposed
of on browser close; you can disable this feature using the
`--enable-session-cookies` option.

## Cookie Names

There are two parameters which you can use to set up cookie names for access token and refresh token.

```
--cookie-access-name=myAccessTokenCookie
--cookie-refresh-name=myRefreshTokenCookie
```

## Allowed Query Params for Authentication

Sometimes you may want to pass some query params to IDP e.g. `kc_idp_hint` or `ui_locales` etc...Gatekeeper provides param `allowed-query-params`
where you can specify which query params will be forwarded to IDP

This example will allow passing `myparam` and `yourparam` with any value to IDP:

```bash
  --allowed-query-params="myparam" \
  --allowed-query-params="yourparam"
```

yaml example:
```yaml
  allowed-query-params:
    myparam: ""
    yourparam: ""
```

This example will allow passing `myparam` and `yourparam` only with specified value:
```bash
  --allowed-query-params="myparam=myvalue" \
  --allowed-query-params="yourparam=yourvalue"
```

yaml example:
```yaml
  allowed-query-params:
    myparam: "myvalue"
    yourparam: "yourvalue"
```

## Default Query Params for Authentication

Similarly, you can add `--default-query-params` on the Gogatekeeper configuration, they'll be passed to the IdP with the pre-defined values on the configuration. Notice that these parameters will override the ones defined on `--allowed-query-params`.

The example below injects `kc_idp_hint=google` and `ui_locales=pt_BR` as query parameters with pre-defined values to the IdP:

```bash
  --default-query-params="kc_idp_hint=google" \
  --default-query-params="ui_locales=pt_BR"
```

Using the yaml configuration, this would be:
```yaml
  default-query-params:
    kc_idp_hint: "google"
    ui_locales: "pt_BR"
```

## TCP proxy with HTTP CONNECT

You can protect your TCP services with gogatekeeper by adding `CONNECT` HTTP method to list of `custom-http-methods`. On client side you will need to pass of course token in `Authorization` header (righ now there are few clients which could make HTTP connect with `Bearer` token and then forward tcp, e.g. gost proxy - but only in static way, some IDE provide HTTP CONNECT functionality for db connectors but only with `Basic` authentication, we would like to add this functionality to gatekeeper in future). This setup will authenticate connection at start and will create tunnel to your backend service. Please use with care and ensure that it allows connection only to intended services, otherwise it can be missused for various attacks.

This example allows users with valid token to connect to backend postgres service:

```
  "--discovery-url=http://127.0.0.1:8081/realms/test/.well-known/openid-configuration",
  "--client-id=test-client",
  "--client-secret=6447d0c0-d510-42a7-b654-6e3a16b2d7e2",
  "--upstream-url=http://127.0.0.1:5432",
  "--listen=0.0.0.0:5000",
  "--no-redirects=true",
  "--enable-authorization-header=true",
  "--custom-http-methods=CONNECT",
  "--enable-default-deny=true",
  "--enable-logging=true",
  "--enable-compression=true",
  "--enable-json-logging=true",
  "--verbose=true",
  "--skip-token-verification=false",
  "--upstream-keepalive-timeout=30s",
  "--scopes=openid",
  "--skip-access-token-clientid-check=true"
```

Configuration for gost proxy, to forward your tcp client connection with HTTP CONNECT, please be aware that you need to input there your token (there is only example token in this config):

```

start gost proxy:

```
gost -C config.yaml
```

Connect with psql client:

```
psql -U postgres -h localhost -p 8000
```

## Websocket proxy

You can protect also websocket servers with gatekeeper proxy. You must use standard upgrade headers to proxy to your websocket backend.
There are additional considerations you need to take into account when protecting websocket backend. Browsers doesn't have built-in protection against CORS for websocket protocol like they have for HTTP. That means you need
to consider enabling additional methods for verifying that browsers connect only to your backend and receives response only from your backend.
For this we recommend to turn-on `--enable-encrypted-token` and `--encryption-key` options and also verify `Origin` header with headers matching, please
refer to [Headers matching](#headers-matching).

## HMAC Signature, signing and verification

For raising your security you can verify/sign HMAC for your requests.
Signing can be done when using `--enable-hmac` with forward signing feature below.
Verification is done when using gatekeeper as authentication/authorization proxy.
Gatekeeper in forward-signing mode creates signature, this is also
signature which gatekeeper expects when used as auth/authz proxy, you can create
this signature on your own, assuming you have proper secret. Signature is passed
in `X-HMAC-SHA256` header. Signature is created by signing several fields:

```
	stringToSign := fmt.Sprintf(
		"%s\n%s%s\n%s;%s;%s",
		req.Method,
		req.URL.Path,
		req.URL.RawQuery,
		req.Header.Get(constant.AuthorizationHeader),
		req.Host,
		sha256.Sum256(body),
	)
```

## Forward-signing proxy

Forward-signing provides a mechanism for authentication and
authorization between services using tokens issued from the IdP. When
operating in this mode the proxy will automatically acquire an access
token (handling the refreshing or logins on your behalf) and tag
outbound requests with an Authorization header. You can control which
domains are tagged with the `--forwarding-domains` option. Note, this
option uses a **contains** comparison on domains. So, if you wanted to
match all domains under \*.svc.cluster.local you can use:
`--forwarding-domain=svc.cluster.local`.

You can choose between two types of OAuth authentications: *password* grant type (default) or *client\_credentials* grant type.

Example setup password grant:

You have a collection of micro-services which are permitted to speak to
one another; you have already set up the credentials, roles, and clients
in Keycloak, providing granular role controls over issue tokens.

``` yaml
- name: gatekeeper
  image: quay.io/gogatekeeper/gatekeeper:2.11.0
  args:
  - --enable-forwarding=true
  - --forwarding-username=projecta
  - --forwarding-password=some_password
  - --forwarding-domains=projecta.svc.cluster.local
  - --forwarding-domains=projectb.svc.cluster.local
  - --client-id=xxxxxx
  - --client-secret=xxxx
  - --discovery-url=http://keycloak:8080/realms/master
  - --tls-ca-certificate=/etc/secrets/ca.pem
  - --tls-ca-key=/etc/secrets/ca-key.pem
  # Note: if you don't specify any forwarding domains, all domains will be signed; Also the code checks is the
  # domain 'contains' the value (it's not a regex) so if you wanted to sign all requests to svc.cluster.local, just use
  # svc.cluster.local
  volumeMounts:
  - name: keycloak-socket
    mountPoint: /var/run/keycloak
- name: projecta
  image: some_images

```

Example setup client credentials grant:

``` yaml
- name: gatekeeper
  image: quay.io/gogatekeeper/gatekeeper:2.11.0
  args:
  - --enable-forwarding=true
  - --forwarding-domains=projecta.svc.cluster.local
  - --forwarding-domains=projectb.svc.cluster.local
  - --client-id=xxxxxx
  - --client-secret=xxxx
  - --discovery-url=http://keycloak:8080/realms/master
  - --tls-ca-certificate=/etc/secrets/ca.pem
  - --tls-ca-key=/etc/secrets/ca-key.pem
  - --forwarding-grant-type=client_credentials
  # Note: if you don't specify any forwarding domains, all domains will be signed; Also the code checks is the
  # domain 'contains' the value (it's not a regex) so if you wanted to sign all requests to svc.cluster.local, just use
  # svc.cluster.local
  volumeMounts:
  - name: keycloak-socket
    mountPoint: /var/run/keycloak
- name: projecta
  image: some_images

```    
Test the forward proxy:

```
curl -k --proxy http://127.0.0.1:3000 https://test.projesta.svc.cluster.local
```

On the receiver side, you could set up the Gatekeeper Proxy
`--no-redirects=true` and permit this to verify and handle admission for
you. Alternatively, the access token can found as a bearer token in the
request.

## Forwarding signed HTTPS connections

Handling HTTPS requires a man-in-the-middle sort of TLS connection. By
default, if no `--tls-ca-certificate` and `--tls-ca-key` are provided
the proxy will use the default certificate. If you wish to verify the
trust, you’ll need to generate a CA, for example.

``` bash
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca.key -out ca.pem
$ bin/gatekeeper \
  --enable-forwarding \
  --forwarding-username=USERNAME \
  --forwarding-password=PASSWORD \
  --client-id=CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret=SECRET \
  --discovery-url=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/test \
  --tls-ca-certificate=ca.pem \
  --tls-ca-key=ca-key.pem
```

## Forwarding with UMA token

When `--enable-uma` is set in forwarding mode, proxy signs request with RPT token

## HTTPS redirect

The proxy supports an HTTP listener, so the only real requirement here
is to perform an HTTP → HTTPS redirect. You can enable the option like
this:

``` bash
--listen-http=127.0.0.1:80
--enable-security-filter=true  # is required for the https redirect
--enable-https-redirection
```

## Let’s Encrypt configuration

Here is an example of the required configuration for Let’s Encrypt
support:

``` yaml
listen: 0.0.0.0:443
enable-https-redirection: true
enable-security-filter: true
use-letsencrypt: true
letsencrypt-cache-dir: ./cache/
redirection-url: https://domain.tld:443/
hostnames:
  - domain.tld
```

Listening on port 443 is mandatory.

## Access token encryption

By default, the session token is placed into a cookie in plaintext. If
you prefer to encrypt the session cookie, use the
`--enable-encrypted-token` and `--encryption-key` options. Note that the
access token forwarded in the X-Auth-Token header to upstream is
unaffected.

## Bearer token passthrough

If your Bearer token is intended for your upstream application and not for gatekeeper
you can use option ``--skip-authorization-header-identity``. Please be aware that
token is still required to be in cookies.

## Upstream headers

On protected resources, the upstream endpoint will receive a number of
headers added by the proxy, along with custom claims, like this:

- X-Auth-Email
- X-Auth-ExpiresIn
- X-Auth-Groups
- X-Auth-Roles
- X-Auth-Subject
- X-Auth-Token
- X-Auth-Userid
- X-Auth-Username

To control the `Authorization` header use the
`enable-authorization-header` YAML configuration or the
`--enable-authorization-header` command line option. By default, this
option is set to `true`.

## Custom claim headers

You can inject additional claims from the access token into the
upstream headers with the `--add-claims` option. For example, a
token from a Keycloak provider might include the following
claims:

``` yaml
"resource_access": {},
"name": "Beloved User",
"preferred_username": "beloved.user",
"given_name": "Beloved",
"family_name": "User",
"email": "beloved@example.com"
```

In order to request you receive the *given\_name*, *family\_name*, and name
in the authentication header, we would add `--add-claims=given_name` and
`--add-claims=family_name` and so on, or we can do it in the
configuration file, like this:

``` yaml
add-claims:
- given_name
- family_name
- name
```

This would add the additional headers to the authenticated request along
with standard ones.

``` bash
X-Auth-Family-Name: User
X-Auth-Given-Name: Beloved
X-Auth-Name: Beloved User
```

## Custom headers

You can inject custom headers using the `--headers="name=value"` option
or the configuration file:

    headers:
      name: value

## OpenID provider headers

In some cases you might need to send headers to your OpenId provider discovery endpoint (e.g. you have your endpoint protected by basic auth).
For this use cases there is `--openid-provider-headers` option:

```yaml
openid-provider-headers:
  - X-SEND: "MYVALUE"
  - X-OTHER-SEND: "NEXT VALUE"
```

```bash
  --openid-provider-headers="myheader1=value1" \
  --openid-provider-headers="myheader2=value2"
```
## Encryption key

In order to remain stateless and not have to rely on a central cache to
persist the *refresh\_tokens*, the refresh token is encrypted and added as
a cookie using **crypto/aes**. The key must be the same if you are
running behind a load balancer. The key length should be either *16* or *32*
bytes, depending or whether you want *AES-128* or *AES-256*.

## Claim matching

The proxy supports adding a variable list of claim matches against the
presented tokens for additional access control. You can match the 'iss'
or 'aud' to the token or custom attributes; each of the matches are
regexes. For example, `--match-claims 'aud=sso.*'` or `--claim
iss=https://.*'` or via the configuration file, like this:

``` yaml
match-claims:
  aud: openvpn
  iss: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/commons
```

or via the CLI, like this:

``` bash
--match-claims=auth=openvpn
--match-claims=iss=http://keycloak.example.com/realms/commons
```

You can limit the email domain permitted; for example, if you want to
limit to only users on the example.com domain:

``` yaml
match-claims:
  email: ^.*@example.com$
```

The adapter supports matching on multi-value strings claims. The match
will succeed if one of the values matches, for example:

``` yaml
match-claims:
  perms: perm1
```

will successfully match

``` json
{
  "iss": "https://sso.example.com",
  "sub": "",
  "perms": ["perm1", "perm2"]
}
```

## Group claims

You can match on the group claims within a token via the `groups`
parameter available within the resource. While roles are implicitly
required, such as `roles=admin,user` where the user MUST have roles
'admin' AND 'user', groups are applied with an OR operation, so
`groups=users,testers` requires that the user MUST be within either
'users' OR 'testers'. The claim name is hard-coded to `groups`, so a *JWT*
token would look like this:

``` json
{
  "iss": "https://sso.example.com",
  "sub": "",
  "aud": "test",
  "exp": 1515269245,
  "iat": 1515182845,
  "email": "beloved@example.com",
  "groups": [
    "group_one",
    "group_two"
  ],
  "name": "Beloved"
}
```

## Headers matching

You can match on the request headers  via the `headers`
parameter available within the resource. Headers are implicitly
required, such as `headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue` where the request 
MUST have headers 'x-some-header' with value 'somevalue' AND 'x-other-header', with value 'othervalue'.

## Forward-auth

Traefik, nginx ingress and other gateways usually have feature called forward-auth.
This enables them to forward request to external auth/authz service which returns 2xx in case
auth/authz was successful and otherwise some higher code (usually 401/403) or redirects them 
for authentication to keycloak server. You can use
gatekeeper as this external auth/authz service by using headers matching feature as describe above
and enabling `--no-proxy` option (this option will not forward request to upstream).

Example:

traefik forward-auth configuration when you don't want to redirect user to authentication 
server by gatekeeper (useful for e.g. API authentication or when you are using redirect
to keycloak server on front proxy)

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: dashboard-apis-oauth
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: dashboard
  name: dashboard-apis-oauth
  namespace: censored
spec:
  forwardAuth:
    address: http://gatekeeper-dns-name:4180
```

gatekeeper configuration

```yaml
  - args:
      - --client-id=dashboard
      - --no-redirects=true # this option will ensure there will be no redirects
      - --no-proxy=true # this option will ensure that request will be not forwarded to upstream
      - --listen=0.0.0.0:4180
      - --discovery-url=https://keycloak-dns-name/realms/censored
      - --enable-default-deny=true # this option will ensure protection of all paths /*, according our traefik config, traefik will send it to /
      - --resources=headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue
```

traefik forward-auth configuration when you WANT to redirect user to authentication 
server by gatekeeper (useful for e.g. frontend application authentication). Please be
aware that in this mode you need to forward headers X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Uri, X-Forwarded-Proto, from
front proxy to gatekeeper. You can find more complete example [here](https://github.com/gogatekeeper/gatekeeper/blob/master/e2e/k8s/manifest_test_forwardauth.yml). 

*NOTE*: Please very important is to forward `prefix` (means all paths with prefix) ```/oauth```
directly to gatekeeper service as you can see in manifest, otherwise you will see redirect loop.

*IMPORTANT*: Please ensure that you are receiving headers only from trusted proxy
and gatekeeper is not exposed directly to internet, otherwise attacker might misuse this!

```yaml
apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
kind: Middleware
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: dashboard-apis-oauth
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: dashboard
  name: dashboard-apis-oauth
  namespace: censored
spec:
  forwardAuth:
    address: http://gatekeeper-dns-name:4180
```

gatekeeper configuration:

```yaml
  - args:
      - --client-id=dashboard
      - --no-redirects=false # this option will ensure there WILL BE redirects to keycloak server
      - --no-proxy=true # this option will ensure that request will be not forwarded to upstream
      - --listen=0.0.0.0:4180
      - --discovery-url=https://keycloak-dns-name/realms/censored
      - --enable-default-deny=true # this option will ensure protection of all paths /*, according our traefik config, traefik will send it to /
      - --resources=headers=x-some-header:somevalue,x-other-header:othervalue
```

in some cases you maybe use traefik without k8s, here is example traefik configuration, no k8s resources:

```yaml
http:
 routers:
   app:
     entryPoints:
       - "websecure"
     rule: "Host(`domain.org`)"
     middlewares:
       - "app-middleware"
       - "app-headers"
     tls:
       certResolver: letsencrypt
     service: app-service

   app-proxy:
     entryPoints:
       - "websecure"
     rule: "Host(`domain.org`) && PathPrefix(`/oauth`)" # here you see that /oauth prefix is routed directly to gatekeeper
     tls:
       certResolver: letsencrypt
     service: app-proxy

################     
 
  middlewares:
    app-headers:
      headers:
        customRequestHeaders:
          X-Forwarded-Proto: https
          X-Forwarded-Host: domain.org
          X-Forwarded-Uri: /

    app-middleware:
      forwardAuth:
        address: "http://192.168.140.93:4180 # gatekeeper container address

#####################          
 services:          
   app-service:
     loadBalancer:
       servers:
         - url: "http://192.168.x.x:80" # App container address
       passHostHeader: true

   app-proxy:
     loadBalancer:
       servers:
         - url: "http://192.168.x.x:4180" # Gatekeeper container address
       passHostHeader: true
```

nginx forward-auth configuration, nginx is more strict than traefik and rejects redirects,
so in this case redirection to authorization server can be done only on nginx, example:

```yaml
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
     auth_request /auth;
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet: |
     location ^~ /auth {
          internal;
          proxy_pass <gatekeeper-url>/$request_uri;
          proxy_pass_request_body off;
          proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-URI $request_uri;
          proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
          proxy_buffers 8 32k;
          proxy_buffer_size 32k;
     }
```

gatekeeper configuration, must be ```--no-proxy=true with --no-redirects=true```


## Custom pages

By default, Gatekeeper Proxy will immediately redirect you
for authentication and hand back a 403 for access denied. Most users
will probably want to present the user with a more friendly sign-in and
access denied page. You can pass the command line options (or via config
file) paths to the files with `--sign-in-page=PATH`. The sign-in page
will have a 'redirect' variable passed into the scope and holding the
OAuth redirection URL. If you wish to pass additional variables into the
templates, such as title, sitename and so on, you can use the -`-tags
key=pair` option, like this: `--tags title="This is my site"` and the
variable would be accessible from `{{ .title }}`.

``` html
<html>
<body>
<a href="{{ .redirect }}">Sign-in</a>
</body>
</html>
```

### Custom Error Page for Bad Request

One use case for this is that: inside keycloak server have "required user actions" set to "Terms and Conditions". That means, if it is the first time an user access app X, he will need to accept the T&C or decline. If he accepts the terms, he can login fine to app X. However, if he declines it, he gets an empty error page with "bad request".

You can use built-in template or your custom:

```
--error-page=templates/error.html.tmpl
```

## White-listed URL’s

Depending on how the application URL’s are laid out, you might want
protect the root / URL but have exceptions on a list of paths, for
example `/health`. While this is best solved by adjusting the paths, you
can add exceptions to the protected resources, like this:

``` yaml
  resources:
  - uri: /some_white_listed_url
    white-listed: true
  - uri: /*
    methods:
      - GET
    roles:
      - <CLIENT_APP_NAME>:<ROLE_NAME>
      - <CLIENT_APP_NAME>:<ROLE_NAME>
```

Or on the command line

``` bash
  --resources "uri=/some_white_listed_url|white-listed=true"
  --resources "uri=/*"  # requires authentication on the rest
  --resources "uri=/admin*|roles=admin,superuser|methods=POST,DELETE"
```

## PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

Gatekeeper supports PKCE with S256 code challenge method. It stores code verifier in cookie.
You can set custom cookie name with `--cookie-pkce-name`.

## Mutual TLS

The proxy support enforcing mutual TLS for the clients by adding the
`--tls-ca-certificate` command line option or configuration file option.
All clients connecting must present a certificate that was signed by
the CA being used.

## Certificate rotation

The proxy will automatically rotate the server certificates if the files
change on disk. Note, no downtime will occur as the change is made
inline. Clients who connected before the certificate rotation will be
unaffected and will continue as normal with all new connections
presented with the new certificate.

## Refresh tokens

If a request for an access token contains a refresh token and
`--enable-refresh-tokens` is set to `true`, the proxy will automatically
refresh the access token for you. The tokens themselves are kept either
as an encrypted (`--encryption-key=KEY`) cookie **(cookie name:
kc-state).** or a store **(still requires encryption key)**.

To enable a local Redis store use `redis://user:secret@localhost:6379/0?protocol=3`.
See [redis-uri](https://github.com/redis/redis-specifications/blob/master/uri/redis.txt) specification 
In both cases, the refresh token is encrypted before being placed into
the store.

## Post Login Redirect

Without this option if user comes to site protected by gatekeeper e.g. `http://somesite/somepath`, user
will be redirected to login and after login back to `http://somesite/path`. If user comes to `/` before login
he will be redirected back to `/`. Sometimes you want redirect user back not to `/` but some path. For this
there is option `--post-login-redirect-path=/fallback/path` which enables you to define some path to which user will be redirected
after login if user comes to root path `/`. 

## Logout endpoint

There are 2 possibilities how to logout:

1. Using gatekeeper own mechanism `--enable-logout-redirect=false`
   In this case calling **/oauth/logout** will use revocation endpoint which might be set by option `--revocation-url`
   or if not set it will be retrieved from keycloak OpenID discovery response <https://keycloak.example.com/realms/REALM_NAME/protocol/openid-connect/revoke>.
   By default it will try to retrieve token from authorization header or access token cookie and then token from refresh token cookie, if latter present
   it will be used for revocation, if not first will be used. If access token is passed to revocation endpoint
   it will only revoke that access token, so on next request with refresh token user will get new access token.
   If refresh token is passed to revocation endpoint it will revoke refresh token and all access tokens.
   Thus it is recommended to pass refresh tokens, this means for `--no-redirects=false` (code flow) you should
   enable refresh tokens `--enable-refresh-tokens=true` so that refresh cookie will be passed to endpoint. 
   For `--no-redirects=true` you have to pass refresh token in authorization header.

   Post Logout Redirection - redirection url will be gathered from this places from highest priority to lowest:

   - --post-logout-redirect-uri option - recommended
   - **/oauth/logout?redirect=url** - from `redirect` url query parameter, not recommended, kept only for convenience
   - --redirection-url option

2. Using keycloak mechanism, valid only for keycloak 18+ `--enable-logout-redirect=true`
   Uses keycloak logout endpoint <https://keycloak.example.com/realms/REALM_NAME/protocol/openid-connect/logout>.
   
   Post Logout Redirection - you can specify url in `--post-logout-redirect-uri` option, this logout mechanism uses
   id token for logging out, in case of code flow this is gathered automatically from id token cookie. In case of
   `--no-redirects=true` you have to pass id token in authorization header.

### Session logout

Many times there are cases when you have multiple applications (multiple keycloak clients for gatekeeper) and you would
like to achieve that logout on one application causes logout also on other application. For this use case there is option
`--enable-idp-session-check=true` together with `--enable-logout-redirect=true`.

## Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

You can add a CORS header via the `--cors-[method]` with these
configuration options.

  - Access-Control-Allow-Origin

  - Access-Control-Allow-Methods

  - Access-Control-Allow-Headers

  - Access-Control-Expose-Headers

  - Access-Control-Allow-Credentials

  - Access-Control-Max-Age

You can add using the config file:

``` yaml
cors-origins:
- '*'
cors-methods:
- GET
- POST
```

or via the command line:

``` bash
--cors-origins [--cors-origins option]                  a set of origins to add to the CORS access control (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
--cors-methods [--cors-methods option]                  the method permitted in the access control (Access-Control-Allow-Methods)
--cors-headers [--cors-headers option]                  a set of headers to add to the CORS access control (Access-Control-Allow-Headers)
--cors-exposes-headers [--cors-exposes-headers option]  set the expose cors headers access control (Access-Control-Expose-Headers)
```

## Upstream URL

You can control the upstream endpoint via the `--upstream-url` option.
Both HTTP and HTTPS are supported with TLS verification and keep-alive
support configured via the `--skip-upstream-tls-verify` /
`--upstream-keepalives` option. Note, the proxy can also upstream via a
UNIX socket, `--upstream-url unix://path/to/the/file.sock`.

## Endpoints

  - **/oauth/authorize** is authentication endpoint which will generate
    the OpenID redirect to the provider

  - **/oauth/callback** is provider OpenID callback endpoint

  - **/oauth/expired** is a helper endpoint to check if a access token
    has expired, 200 for ok and, 401 for no token and 401 for expired

  - **/oauth/health** is the health checking endpoint for the proxy, you
    can also grab version from headers

  - **/oauth/login** provides a relay endpoint to login via
    `grant_type=password`, for example, `POST /oauth/login` form values
    are `username=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD` (must be enabled)

  - **/oauth/logout** provides a convenient endpoint to log the user
    out, it will always attempt to perform a back channel log out of
    offline tokens

  - **/oauth/token** is a helper endpoint which will display the current
    access token for you

  - **/oauth/metrics** is a Prometheus metrics handler

  - **/oauth/discovery** provides endpoint with basic urls gatekeeper provides

## External Authorization

### Open Policy Agent (OPA) authorization

In version 1.8.8 we are introducing external authorization with OPA (applicable to auth code flow `--no-redirects=false` as well as for `--no-redirects=true`).
Gatekeeper sends request with this structure to OPA for authorization:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "body": "{\"name\": \"test\"}" // body is sent as string so you will have to unmarshal it in case of json/yaml in OPA
    "headers": {
      "X-SOME": ["some value", "other value"],
    },
	  "host": "some.com",
	  "protocol": "HTTP/1.1",
	  "path": "/test",
	  "remote_addr": "192.168.1.90",
	  "method": "POST",
	  "user_agent": "Firefox",
  }
}
```

Example gatekeeper configuration:

```yaml
  enable-opa: true
	enable-default-deny: true
	opa-timeout: "60s"
  opa-authz-uri: "http://127.0.0.1/v1/data/authz/allow"
```

Example OPA policy, with upper gatekeeper configuration and request would result allowing request to upstream:

```
  package authz

  default allow := false

  body := json.unmarshal(input.body)
  allow {
    body.name = "test"
    body.method = "POST"
  }
```

### Keycloak authorization (UMA)

Gatekeeper has ability of external authorization with keycloak using `--enable-uma` option for browser flows and also api flows.
You have to also either populate resources or use `--enable-default-deny` (see examples in previous sections). So you can mix both external authorization+static resource permissions, but
we don't recommend it to not overcomplicate setup. First is always external authorization then static resource authorization.
As it is new feature please don't use it in production, we would like first to receive feedback/testing by community. 
Right now we use external authorization options provided by Keycloak which are specified in UMA (user managed access specification [UMA](https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html)).
To use this feature you **MUST** execute these actions in **keycloak**:

1. enable authorization for client in keycloak (client which you will use in gatekeeper)
2. in client authorization tab, you MUST have at least one protected resource
3. protected resource MUST have User-Managed Access enabled
4. protected resource MUST have at least one authorization scope
5. protected resource MUST have proper permissions set

[Example Keycloak Authorization Guide](https://gruchalski.com/posts/2020-09-05-introduction-to-keycloak-authorization-services/).

#### Example Browser Flow:

```bash
  --discovery-url=<DISCOVERY_URL>
  --openid-provider-timeout=120s
  --listen=0.0.0.0:3000
  --client-id=<CLIENT_ID>
  --client-secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>
  --upstream-url=<UPSTREAM_URL>
  # code flow/browser flow
  --no-redirects=false
  # you have to set this or resources=/* to have enable-uma working
  --enable-default-deny=true
  # we are enabling UMA
  --enable-uma=true
  # we are also enabling using method scope, this is optional,
  # it will check resource in keycloak not just for accessed URL
  # but also for method scope e.g. method:GET, it will return
  # UMA token in cookie only for that URL+method scope,
  # if you don't turn it on it will check just for URL 
  # and will return UMA token in cookie
  # with all scopes
  --enable-uma-method-scope=true
  # UMA token is stored in cookie, you can setup custom name
  # by default cookie name is uma_token
  --cookie-uma-name=<CUSTOM_COOKIE_NAME>
  --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true
  --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true
  --openid-provider-retry-count=30
```

**NOTE**: You can have only one resource with same URL+method scope combination or URL (in case you don't have method scope enabled), if you have
more your access will be forbidden

#### Example API Flow:

we are recommending to use UMA forward signing for these purpose on client app side, otherwise you will have to get RPT token for client side manually.
On client app side, forward signing setup (you app should have http proxy options set to this forward-signing proxy):

```bash
  --discovery-url=<DISCOVERY_URL>
  --openid-provider-timeout=120s
  --listen=0.0.0.0:3000
  --client-id=<CLIENT_ID>
  --client-secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>
  --enable-uma=true
  --enable-uma-method-scope=true
  --enable-forwarding=true
  # you can use client credentials grant or direct access grant
  # see Forward-signing proxy section
  --forwarding-grant-type=client_credentials
  --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true
  --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true
  --openid-provider-retry-count=30
```

On server side, UMA in no-redirects mode:

```bash
  --discovery-url=<DISCOVERY_URL>
  --openid-provider-timeout=120s
  --listen=0.0.0.0:3000
  --client-id=<CLIENT_ID>
  --client-secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>
  --upstream-url=<UPSTREAM_URL>
  # api flow
  --no-redirects=true
  # you have to set this or resources=/* to have enable-uma working
  --enable-default-deny=true
  # we are enabling UMA
  --enable-uma=true
  # we are also enabling using method scope, this is optional,
  # it will check resource in keycloak not just for accessed URL
  # but also for method scope e.g. method:GET, it will return
  # UMA token in cookie only for that URL+method scope,
  # if you don't turn it on it will check just for URL 
  # and will return UMA token in cookie
  # with all scopes
  --enable-uma-method-scope=true
  --skip-access-token-clientid-check=true
  --skip-access-token-issuer-check=true
  --openid-provider-retry-count=30
```

## Request tracing

Usually when there are multiple http services involved in serving user requests
you need to use X-REQUEST-ID or some other header to track request flow through
services. To make this possible with gatekeeper you can enable header logging
by enabling `--enable-logging` and `--verbose` options. Also you can use `request-id-header`
and `enable-request-id` options, which will generate unique uuid and will inject in
header supplied in `request-id-header` option.

## Metrics

Assuming `--enable-metrics` has been set, a Prometheus endpoint can be
found on **/oauth/metrics**; at present the only metric being exposed is
a counter per HTTP code.

## Limitations

Keep in mind [browser cookie
limits](http://browsercookielimits.squawky.net/) if you use access or
refresh tokens in the browser cookie. Gatekeeper Proxy divides
the cookie automatically if your cookie is longer than 4093 bytes. The real
size of the cookie depends on the content of the issued access token.
Also, encryption might add additional bytes to the cookie size. If you
have large cookies (\>200 KB), you might reach browser cookie limits.

All cookies are part of the header request, so you might find a problem
with the max headers size limits in your infrastructure (some load
balancers have very low this value, such as 8 KB). Be sure that all
network devices have sufficient header size limits. Otherwise, your
users won’t be able to obtain an access token.

## Known Issues

There WAS a known issue with the Keycloak server 4.6.0.Final in which
Gatekeeper Proxy is unable to find the *client\_id* in the *aud* claim. This
is due to the fact the *client\_id* is not in the audience anymore. The
workaround is to add the "Audience" protocol mapper to the client with
the audience pointed to the *client\_id*. For more information, see
[KEYCLOAK-8954](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-8954).

you can now use `--skip-access-token-clientid-check` and
`--skip-access-token-issuer-check` to overcome this limitations. 
These are now set by default to `true` so you should not by default see any these issues,
but in case you would like to enable this checks you still have opportunity.
